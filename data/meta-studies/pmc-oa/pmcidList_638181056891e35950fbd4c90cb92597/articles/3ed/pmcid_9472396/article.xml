Symptoms associated with PTSD are categorized into clusters according to the DSM 5: (1) intrusion/re-experiencing trauma, (2) avoidance, (3) negative cognition and mood, and (4) hyperarousal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Approximately 70% of adults experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetime and up to 20% of these people develop PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Individuals with PTSD may experience long-term debilitating effects, mentally, physically, and cognitively. In the United States, roughly 8 million adults suffer from PTSD every year. Approximately 60% of men experience at least one traumatic event in their lives, often associated with combat and war, while 50% of women will experience at least one traumatic event, typically associated with sexual assault and abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Current theories aim to understand the etiology of PTSD, including behavioral, cognitive, and social models. Research suggests that reappraisal of traumatic events may lead to an overgeneralized threat response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Despite progress in understanding the vulnerability, symptomatology, and trajectory of PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], the underlying neurobiological determinants of PTSD are less clear. Substantial prior work has attempted to identify structural brain alterations observed among individuals with PTSD. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a commonly used methodological approach for analyzing structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, allowing for quantitative statistical comparisons between groups (e.g., differences in gray matter volume; GMV) to more clearly understand the structural alterations associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as PTSD. Multiple prior meta-analyses have been conducted to identify convergent gray matter reductions in PTSD patients, although consensus across meta-analyses has not been reached. Each of these meta-analyses was conducted with a different scope, with varied study inclusion/exclusion criteria, and subsequently included a wide range of 8 to 20 studies. Varying convergence has been observed across these meta-analyses, which have identified one to five significant clusters in regions that include medial prefrontal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], fusiform gyrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], and lingual gyrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Similarly, from a functional perspective, PTSD dysfunction has been reported as amygdala and frontal disruptions (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] or across alterations of large-scale functional brain networks (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] that are implicated in the tripartite model of psychopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. While some studies have addressed consensus across functional neuroimaging studies, it is challenging to assess convergence across different psychological states and/or experimental paradigms, which has potentially contributed to inconsistent findings in PTSD meta-analyses of resting state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>] or task-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] studies. Overall, this variability across meta-analytic approaches and results suggests that a consensus neurobiological model of PTSD has not yet been achieved.</p><p id="Par7">The objective of the current study was to apply current best practices in coordinate-based neuroimaging methods to investigate the topography of consistently reported structural alterations in PTSD. As PTSD is linked to a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms, which likely reflects the disturbance of distributed, brain-wide neural circuitry, we also sought to functionally and behaviorally characterize any neuroanatomical alterations in a task-independent manner. To this end, we first identified convergent regions of gray matter (GM) reductions in PTSD vs. non-PTSD groups using anatomical likelihood estimation (ALE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Second, we identified the task-free resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) patterns, as well as the task-based meta-analytic co-activation modeling (MACM) patterns of convergent regions, thus providing multimodal functional connectivity profiles for each. Together, the VBM, rsFC, and MACM meta-analytic approaches have been used in previous clinically related meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], they provide complementary information, yielding a multimodal functional connectivity profile for a given region of interest. Lastly, we applied meta-analytic functional decoding methods to identify the mental processes linked to this functional connectivity profile. Collectively, this work utilizes an innovative (meta-) analytic framework to quantitatively assess structural alterations associated with PTSD and the extended functional profiles of regions implicated in this disorder. A more comprehensive understanding of the neurobiological bases of PTSD is needed to delineate future pathways toward improved prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Analytic overview</title><p id="Par8">We first conducted a literature search to identify studies reporting structural alterations comparing the following groups: individuals with PTSD, individuals who experienced trauma but were not diagnosed with PTSD, and individuals who did not report experiencing trauma.

We then used multiple connectivity modeling approaches to comprehensively characterize the functional connectivity of these convergent regions.

Next, we performed a PubMed search to identify additional peer-reviewed, structural MRI studies of interest using the search terms “morphometry + PTSD”. The PubMed search aimed to identify any potential studies that were not included in the previously published meta-analyses. We then conducted a review of each identified publication to include the following study criteria: peer-reviewed MRI studies, reporting results among adult humans, written in the English language, focused on gray matter structural differences, and included original data (i.e., not a review). Subsequently, exclusion criteria were as follows: trauma or stressful life event studies not measuring PTSD, other non-voxel-based morphometry methods, treatment and longitudinal effects, papers reporting <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> regions of interest (ROIs), within-group effects, null effects, overlapping samples to previous studies, and studies that did not report coordinate-based results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Anatomical likelihood estimation (ALE)</title><p id="Par10">ALE is a voxel-based meta-analytic technique that identifies convergent coordinates (i.e., foci) across a set of neuroimaging studies.

We used the coordinate-based ALE method as implemented in NiMARE v.0.0.3 (Neuroimaging Meta-Analysis Research Environment; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], a Python library for neuroimaging meta-analysis.

Once transformed, statistical probability maps were created for each foci and combined to model the likelihood that a given voxel displayed a between-group structural difference for each study. Observed voxel-wise ALE scores characterized the most consistently reported foci across the whole brain. Significance testing and correction for multiple comparisons involved thresholding the voxel-wise ALE map using a cluster-forming threshold of <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001. Then, a permutation procedure was performed in which a null distribution of maximum cluster sizes was generated from 10,000 iterations of replacing reported foci with randomly selected gray matter voxels, generating ALE maps from the randomized dataset, and identifying the maximum cluster size after thresholding at <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001.

On November 12, 2019, 150 randomly selected participants (28.7 ± 3.9 years) were downloaded via the HCP’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Solution (S3) repository. The randomly chosen participants included 77 females (30.3 ± 3.5 years) and 73 males (27.1 ± 3.7 years). A difference in age between the two biological sex groups was significant but is consistent with the 1200 Subjects Data Release.

Each participant underwent T1-weighted and T2-weighted structural acquisitions and four resting-state fMRI acquisitions. Structural images were collected at 0.7-mm isotropic resolution. Whole-brain EPI acquisitions were acquired on the 3T Siemens Connectome scanner: 32-channel head coil, TR = 720 msec, TE = 33.1 msec, in-plane FOV = 208 × 180 mm, 72 slices, 2.0 mm isotropic voxels, and multiband acceleration factor of 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">The S1200 data release contained minimally pre-processed and denoised data. The minimal pre-processing workflow is described by Glasser and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], but consists of typical imaging pre-processing techniques that leverage the high-quality data acquired by the HCP. First, T1- and T2-weighted images were aligned, bias field corrected, and registered to MNI space. Second, the functional fMRI pipeline removed spatial distortions, realigned volumes to compensate for subject motion, registered the fMRI data to structural volumes (in MNI space), reduced the bias field, normalized each functional acquisition to its corresponding global mean, and masked non-brain tissue. Noteworthily, care was taken to minimize smoothing induced by interpolation and that no overt volume smoothing was performed.</p><p id="Par14">The fMRI signal contains many sources of variability, including artifactual and non-neuronal signals, that make identifying the underlying neuronal activity difficult.

Briefly, ICA was performed on each functional dataset independently and characteristics of each component, such as spatial localization and power in high frequencies, were evaluated by a classifier to determine if a given component was related to neuronal activity or artifact.

To do so, we relied on the Neurosynth database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>], which archives published stereotactic coordinates from over 14,000 fMRI studies and 150,000 brain locations. Neurosynth relies on an automated coordinate extraction tool to “scrape” each available fMRI study for reported coordinates. Due to the nature of this automated process, fMRI studies reporting results of multiple experimental contrasts as separate sets of coordinates are amalgamated into a single set of coordinates; in addition, “activation” and “de-activation” coordinates are not distinctly characterized. However, while this inherent “noise” may limit interpretational abilities, the power over manually curated datasets outweighs the potential confounds of bi-directional or mixed-contrast effects.</p><p id="Par17">To generate a MACM map for each ROI, we utilized NiMARE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] to search the Neurosynth database for all studies reporting at least one peak within the defined ROI mask. Neurosynth tools implement the multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) algorithm for performing meta-analyses based on a subset of studies, such as that described here. However, we opted to use the ALE algorithm as implemented in NiMARE given its optimal performance in replicating image-based meta-and mega-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. The ALE algorithm requires sample size information, or the number of subjects, that contributed to a given experimental contrast to generate a smoothing kernel. However, Neurosynth is not able to capture sample size (which could also vary across experimental contrasts within a study). Thus, we utilized a smoothing kernel with a FWHM of 15 mm, which has been shown to yield results with strong correspondence for image-based meta- and mega-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. The ALE algorithm was applied to the set of studies reporting activation within the boundaries of each ROI. Once ALE maps were generated for each ROI, as described above, voxel-FWE correction (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) was performed to reflect the statistical thresholding approach used for rsFC maps.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Functional decoding: generalized correspondence latent dirichlet allocation (GC-LDA)</title><p id="Par18">We sought to infer what mental processes were most likely linked with brain regions identified in our ALE, MACM, and rsFC analyses. To do so, we utilized generalized correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation (GC-LDA) functional decoding methods in NiMARE applied to the resulting unthresholded ALE, rsFC, and MACM maps. This type of decoding provides an approach to infer mental processes associated with neuroimaging spatial patterns. GC-LDA utilizes probabilistic Bayesian statistics that learns latent topics from a large database of papers (e.g., NeuroSynth) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. From the database, each topic found is treated as a probability distribution and creates a spatial distribution in MNI space across voxels from the maps entered into the decoding algorithm. The “topics” encompass terms and associated brain regions that co-occur in the literature from a literature database. We set our model to 200 topics. We report 10 terms corresponding to the highest weights associated with our ALE, rsFC, and MACM results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Literature search and study criteria</title><p id="Par19">The literature search yielded a total of 85 articles using the above-described search terms.

Within these publications, gray matter structural alterations were assessed by comparing whole-brain VBM results among individuals with and without PTSD, reported as 3D coordinates in MNI or Talairach space. Control comparison groups included individuals who had experienced trauma but did not develop PTSD and individuals who had not experienced trauma. Nineteen publications included trauma-exposed controls (TC), while ten publications included healthy, non-trauma-exposed controls (HC). Altogether, this set of 23 studies collectively examined 476 individuals with PTSD and 892 individuals without PTSD, which included 288 TC and 633 HC. With respect to the type of structural alterations observed, studies reported multiple different VBM metrics. Seventeen publications reported group differences in gray matter volume (GMV), seven publications reported differences in gray matter density (GMD), and one reported gray matter concentration (GMC). Collectively, we refer to all of these metrics as gray matter (GM) differences among individuals with and without PTSD.

Further, we sought to extend the literature and assess potential functional consequences associated with observed structural alterations in PTSD by applying complementary rsFC and MACM analytic techniques. The current meta-analysis of 23 VBM studies evaluating GM volume alterations among PTSD versus non-PTSD groups identified a single node of convergent gray matter loss in the mPFC. GC-LDA-based functional decoding of this cluster was linked to Neurosynth terms of visual, emotional, memory, novel, reward, motor, self, faces, learning, and face. Follow-up ALE analyses exploring GM reductions in PTSD vs. HC (non-traumatized controls) and PTSD vs. TC (trauma-exposed controls not diagnosed with PTSD) yielded null findings likely due to insufficient power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Subsequent analyses of the ALE-derived mPFC cluster were conducted to assess task-free (rsFC) and task-dependent (MACM) functional connectivity, identifying a consistent and widespread functional network implicated in PTSD. These results indicate that structural alterations in the mPFC among individuals with PTSD are possibly linked to disruptions across a larger frontoparietal network that includes the medial, superior, and inferior frontal gyri, PCC, parahippocampal gyri, angular gyri, superior temporal gyrus, thalamus, caudate, and lentiform nucleus. Functional decoding of rsFC and MACM results indicates substantive term overlap with the mPFC ALE results, with additional network-related terms (e.g., default, default mode network, and intrinsic).</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Structural alterations and dysfunction in PTSD</title><p id="Par26">Our current findings suggest the mPFC appears as the most consistently reported brain region across VBM neuroimaging studies exploring the impact of PTSD on brain structure. Previous meta-analyses have identified GM reductions in the mPFC, hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, and lingual gyrus; however, not all of these regions were consistently observed across all meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Beyond the mPFC, we did not observe additional convergent GM reductions, indicating that prior findings in these other regions were not replicated. Across the PTSD literature, there is a high degree of variability associated with participant trauma exposure, length of diagnosis of PTSD, medication use, and comorbidity. Inconsistencies between our findings and previous meta-analytic results could be due to conceptual and methodological differences across the earlier studies, such as the scope of the research question exploring the neurobiology of PTSD, and the subsequent differences in inclusion/exclusion criteria that resulted in different sets of included studies. Comparison of the included studies in this and prior VBM meta-analyses of PTSD indicated varying degrees of overlap, including (from earliest to most recent meta-analyses): 7 of 9 included studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], 14 of 17 included studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], 15 of 20 included studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], 7 of 13 included studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], 7 of 8 included studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and 10 out of 12 included studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Beyond selection of included studies, the meta-analytic approach may contribute to the source of variability across results. Previous meta-analyses used either the ALE approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] or signed differential mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Consistent with the present results, the meta-analyses by Meng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and Klaming et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] also yielded a single cluster in mPFC, which used the SDM method while our current results used the ALE approach. However, of all prior meta-analyses, only the study by Meng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] meets the current threshold of a minimum of 20 contrasts for a well-powered coordinate-based meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. After reviewing the above prior meta-analytic work in comparison to our current results, we conclude that extensive heterogeneity in the PTSD literature, combined with varying meta-analytic inclusive/exclusion criteria, likely contributed to differences between our results and prior meta-analytic findings. To our knowledge, the current meta-analysis of 25 contrasts represents the largest PTSD meta-analysis of structural findings to date, with prior meta-analytic work examining 8-20 included studies. We observed that the mPFC is robustly associated with structural alterations in PTSD; however, it is important to consider how the mPFC is integrated within existing neurocircuitry models associated with PTSD symptomology.</p><p id="Par28">Traditional neurocircuitry models of PTSD utilize a fear-conditioning framework, emphasizing hyperreactivity of the amygdala in response to fear-related stimuli and dysfunction between the mPFC and orbitofrontal cortex, as well as the hippocampus, in attention and top-down control during threat exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. However, limiting consideration of the psychopathology of PTSD to focus on a single brain region (i.e., the amygdala) emphasizes fear-related brain activity while minimizing brain circuitry implicated in the complex constellation of PTSD symptoms associated with response to trauma exposure, such as re-experiencing trauma, avoidance, negative mood, and numbing. These additional processes remain largely unexplained in original PTSD models. However, more recent neurocircuitry models build from this perspective, with increased emphasis on altered function of the mPFC, its role in contextualization, and how context processing is core to the constellation of PTSD symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. While our results indicated convergent structural alterations in the mPFC, we did not observe similar convergence in the amygdala or other regions that have been implicated in prior neurocircuitry models of PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. However, our results are congruent with the expanded models of PTSD and we provide robust evidence in support of the mPFC as a critical node in PTSD neurocircuitry. Further, our functional decoding results provide additional support for the contextualization models of PTSD. Taken together, reduced GM in the mPFC among individuals diagnosed with PTSD supports the premise that these structural alterations may contribute to deficits in context processing and ultimately play a dominant role in contributing to behaviors related to the constellation of symptoms in PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Functional profiles of structural findings in PTSD: support for the tripartite model of psychopathology</title><p id="Par29">rsFC and MACM analyses characterized mPFC functional connectivity as extending across widespread, whole-brain networks engaging frontoparietal and limbic regions. These rsFC and MACM results, in conjunction with functional decoding outcomes, identified a functional connectivity profile suggestive of spatial patterns associated with the default mode network (DMN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], salience mode network (SN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], and central executive network (CEN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. The DMN is a system of connected brain areas including the mPFC, PCC, inferior parietal, and temporal cortices that are often collectively observed as displaying anticorrelation with regions actively engaged during attention-demanding tasks.

The SN consists of the dorsolateral ACC and bilateral insula and is involved in saliency detection and attentional processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Finally, the CEN consists of the dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices and is typically involved in attentionally driven cognitive functions, including goal-directed behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. These three networks are central to a neurobiological theory of psychopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The application of the tripartite model to neurobiology models of psychiatric disorders define dysfunction within and between connectivity of the DMN, SN, and CEN networks and relates to a broad range psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], including PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Overall, the current meta-analysis identified a functional profile of the mPFC associated with connectivity between the DMN, SN, and CEN, which broadly supports a network theory of PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par300">According to the tripartite model of brain function, the SN is thought to mediate activity between the DMN and CEN networks in order to orient to external stimuli or internal salient biological stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], Sripada et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Altered inter- and intra-network functional connectivity between the DMN, SN, and CEN has previously been implicated in PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Specifically, seed-based resting state studies identified decreased connectivity within the DMN and SN, yet increased connectivity between these two networks among PTSD patients (Sripada et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]). Furthermore, other resting state studies on PTSD utilizing graph theory approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and independent component analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>] replicated weakened connectivity within the DMN, SN, and CEN, yet heightened connectivity between the DMN and SN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Taken together, this literature suggests deficits in top-down control over heightened responses to threatening stimuli and abnormal regulation of orienting attention to threatening stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. Patterns from task-based studies reflect previous findings of weakened connectivity between the SN and DMN and heightened connectivity between the SN and CEN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. In a study among individuals with recent trauma exposure, connectivity between the DMN, SN, and CEN was reported to be disrupted among participants who developed PTSD vs. those who do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], providing evidence of differential functional connectivity between PTSD patients and traumatized non-diagnosed individuals. Network dysfunction associated with the DMN, SN, and CEN is also evident in task-based studies, including cues containing trauma stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], eye gaze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], and a broad range of behavioral paradigms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Aberrant connectivity between and within the DMN, SN, and CEN has also been associated with PTSD symptoms, such that heightened connectivity and activity of the DMN was associated with depersonalization/derealization, while weakened connectivity and activity of the CEN was associated with hyperarousal and hypervigilance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Additionally, weakened inter-network connectivity between the SN and DMN has been found to be positively correlated with Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores that measure PTSD symptom severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Moreover, Bluhm et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] found weakened spontaneous activity in regions of the DMN; in addition, posterior cingulate connectivity was positively correlated with self-reported dissociated experiences among participants with PTSD. In sum, the literature on abnormal brain function associated with PTSD points to a pattern of results suggesting that symptoms are related to aberrant connectivity within and between the DMN, SN, and CEN. In a recent review of the neuroimaging literature on PTSD, Lanius et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] summarized this work to reflect that dysfunction in the DMN is associated with an altered sense of self, dysfunction in the SN is associated with hyperarousal and hypervigilance, and dysfunction in the CEN is associated with cognitive dysfunction, including memory and cognitive control deficits.</p><p id="Par30">The results from the current meta-analysis provide a robust mPFC-centric model of PTSD that is aligned with the extant literature and compliments the tripartite model of psychopathology. The mPFC, a core region of the DMN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], is often disrupted in individuals with PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. The results of the present meta-analysis suggest alterations in mPFC structure, and related function, may play a crucial role in the underlying neurobiology of PTSD. Dysfunction of the mPFC is thought to be associated with poorer regulation of contextualization of PTSD symptoms. Prior literature indicates weakened integration of the DMN and disrupted inter-network connectivity with the SN and CEN, representing aberrant dysfunction of these tripartite networks in the psychopathology of PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Most of the prior functional and structural work involved varying analytic approaches, examined heterogeneous populations, and utilized region of interest approaches or <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> hypotheses. The current application of advanced meta-analytic techniques allowed for a whole-brain assessment of structural alterations associated with PTSD and the associated functional profiles of the mPFC. Future work in PTSD should consider integrating network-based analytic approaches with an mPFC-centric tripartite model to investigate differences in neuropathology of PTSD subtypes (e.g., trauma experiences, duration of exposures), characterizing heterogeneous presentations of PTSD symptoms, and potential predispositional developmental effects among youth, adolescent, and adult populations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par31">Our study is limited by several considerations. First, the present meta-analysis is limited by the small number of studies included. The studies that met the standards of inclusion for this study were considered to reduce instances of variance and consider reliability of study findings (inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). By considering the inclusion of trauma-exposed controls, healthy controls, and individuals with PTSD, the number of participants across each group was somewhat unevenly distributed due to small sample sizes in the original studies. However, the current meta-analysis met the previously recommended standard of at least 20 experimental contrasts required to conduct a well-powered meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Second, much heterogeneity exists across the studies included in our meta-analysis. For example, many of the studies had diagnostic criteria for PTSD using different clinical measures and reported different instances of the duration of PTSD (e.g., lifetime vs. first onset). Substantial variability was also present in the type of trauma and duration of exposure to trauma within the different groups for this study. Given these issues, we were unable to classify PTSD subtypes across the included studies and thus have reported results that relate to generalized PTSD. Many of the original studies were not able to clearly disentangle comorbidity of PTSD with other psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety) or report instances of medication and drug abuse. Furthermore, studies relied on various neuroimaging acquisition and analysis methods, which likely introduced additional variability associated with methodological flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the goal of neuroimaging meta-analysis was to examine consensus despite such variability in the literature. With this in mind, we are confident that the mPFC is a significant brain region linked to GM reductions in PTSD, as well as a robust node of the DMN that plays an important role in toggling between the DMN, SN, and CEN. Future transdiagnostic and meta-analytic work is needed to identify similar and unique neurobiological mechanisms of PTSD in comparison to other related disorders, including complementary disease-decoding or structural covariance analysis, which would further advance clinical insight.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par32">The present study utilized coordinate-based meta-analytic techniques to determine that reduced mPFC GM is consistently found among individuals with PTSD. Complementary analyses of rsFC and MACM functional connectivity provided novel insight into how structural alterations may have potential functional consequences. Our results indicated that decreases in mPFC GM may be linked to widespread functional systems that are implicated in behavioral deficits and cluster symptomatology of PTSD. Specifically, consensus-based functional profiles, across task-free and task-based domains, emphasized brain regions associated with the tripartite model of psychiatric disorders where inter- and intra-network connectivity involving the DMN, SN, and CEN are core to PTSD dysfunction. Overall, these results may be important in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the neurobiological bases of PTSD, which is needed to understand the varying diagnosis, symptomatology, and treatment of PTSD, as well as enhanced targeting of treatment towards heterogeneous classification and symptom clusters of PTSD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>
