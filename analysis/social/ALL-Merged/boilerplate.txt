A multilevel kernel density (MKDA) meta-analysis \citep{wager2007meta} was performed was performed with NiMARE 0.6.0+6.g55f7ea1 (RRID:SCR_017398; \citealt{Salo2023}), using a(n) MKDA kernel. An MKDA kernel \citep{wager2007meta} was used to generate study-wise modeled activation maps from coordinates. In this kernel method, each coordinate is convolved with a sphere with a radius of 10.0 and a value of 1. For voxels with overlapping spheres, the maximum value was retained. Summary statistics (OF values) were converted to p-values using an approximate null distribution. The input dataset included 7171 foci from 855 experiments. False discovery rate correction was performed with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure \citep{benjamini1995controlling}.
